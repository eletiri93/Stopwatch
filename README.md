# **Stopwatch software for usability test**

Stopwatch software is a Qt-based interface for reliable usabilty assesment.
The Stopwatch software was developed to ease the observerâ€™s tasks.
For each task within the usability test, the software allows the observer to
record the time of progress while noting down any significant behaviour of
the user: the GUI shows the current task, a stopwatch, and a blank space
for taking notes. On the right side of the screen, a table summarises the
recorded times and notes. At the end of the administration of each task, the
observer is able to export a CSV (Comma Separated Values) file containing
the recorded times and notes

To lunch software a taskList.csv is required, otherwise the interface will run, but all buttons will be disabled.
To use this software please substitute the file tasksList.csv with yours task list, and place it in the build directory.

Note that taskList.csv file must have 3 columns the first one contains task number, the second task text, the third expected time.

Software has been tested using Windows 10
